#     Discuss any unexpected findings. When discussing an unexpected finding, begin the paragraph with the finding and then describe it.
#     Explain how the results and conclusions of this study are important and how they influence our knowledge or understanding of the problem being examined.
#     Provide no more than two recommendations for further research. Do not offer suggestions which could have been done within the study, as this shows there has been inadequate examination and interpretation of the data.

This thesis investigated the important physiological mechanisms involved in
neural processing in the \CNSM. It focused specifically on spectral and temporal
enhancement in the microcircuits regulating the output of \TS cells. It achieved
this through the development and testing of a novel \CNSM model and methods used
to set parameters based on experimental data. Computer modelling enhances our
knowledge of complex neural interactions in \TS cells and provided further
understanding of inputs to higher centres.  By developing a \BNN with a high
degree of realism at the individual cell level, this thesis has contributed to
our understanding of the influence of synaptic organisation of physiological
behaviour in the \CNSM.

This thesis argued that the current state of \BNN models of the \CN or models of
individual cells in the \CNSM model was not considerate of the current physiological
and known experimental data.

It demonstrates through rigorous sequential optimisation that the cell models
and connectivity parameters in the \CNSM model can be created to replicate known
behaviour to tones and noise.






Further insight into the temporal 
response optimised \CNSM model's response to 
BNN optimisation  ---






This chapter concludes the thesis by drawing together the results of the design
and optimisation of the \CNSM model.  It describes the usefulness of the model
as well as the optimisation methods used throughout the thesis.  It reflects on
the implications of the research for the design and optimisation of \BNNs.
Finally it describes the limitations of the research and makes recommendations
for future work arising out of the thesis.

current channels are not suitable to BNN models which have large numbers of

As mentioned in the literature review, little has been done in replication of
microcircuits and medium sized neural networks from experimental data sets.
Very little was found in the literature on the question of replicating neural
outputs from multiple neurons of different cell types.  This thesis set out with
the aim of assessing the importance of optimisation in biophysically realistic
neural microcircuits through either sequential or simultaneous methods.

The specific limitations of the studies in this thesis were canvassed in the relevant chapters.

The limitations of the CNSM model, described and developed in Chapter 3, relate to the specificity of the neural models, the exclusion of synaptic connections without solid foundations,

A number of caveats need to be noted regarding the present study.

Don’t view this necessarily as a list of the limitations of your thesis.
Think of what you would do if you had an extra year in your Ph.D.
Don’t worry – this is not for your advisor to hold your feet to the fire.
Think of 2-3 other follow-on Ph.D. dissertations that you can envision}


Fundamental questions about the behaviour of \TS cells remain for exploration
\citep{OertelWrightEtAl:2011}.  Do intrinsic membrane mechanism or network and
synaptic mechanisms play a greater role in the behaviour of \TS cells?  How are
the different categories of \ANFs (\LSR and \HSR) processed by \TS cell
microcircuit?  What are the effects of connections across isofrequency laminae
and how does this effect the spectral representation across the population of
\TS cells?  While answering these questions was beyond the scope of this thesis,
the model and optimisation methods established in the thesis provide valuable
tools for use in those inquiries.

connections can be achieved through manipulation of the \CNSM model's
parameters.  Further simulations on the pharmacological effects of GABA and

\citep{MuldersPaoliniEtAl:2003}}


\yellownote{Further studies on commissural inputs?Labelled \DS cells project
widely to the VCN and DCN; and in some cases to the contralateral CN in the same
manner \citep{SmithMassieEtAl:2005,ArnottWallaceEtAl:2004} In vivo studies have
already shown the effects of commisural inhibition of first spike responses to
tones \citep{NeedhamPaolini:2007,NeedhamPaolini:2006,NeedhamPaolini:2003}.}

Additionally, enhanced understanding of the complex processing done by the
cochlear nucleus may also contribute to refinement of hearing-impairment
devices.  Further understanding how the processing of sound in noisy
environments works within the network could aid in developing new sound
processing strategies for the cochlear implant and hearing aids.

 Further development is needed to enhance the robustness of
 the cost function methods to input noise, especially for sensitivity and
 robustness of inhibitory connections in the \CN stellate network.





* Concluding Remarks
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:Conc:ConcludingRemarks
:END:


In computational neuroscience the development of BNN models is a promising means
by which we can understand highly complex neural processing.  The accuracy of
this understanding relies on the quality of design and optimisation methods used
upon the experimental data.  This thesis presented a novel BNN model of the
cochlear nucleus stellate microcircuit, which was optimised using rigorous
sequential methods and simultaneous genetic algorithms.  The thesis demonstrates
the utility of this approach for BNN models and out understanding of neural
processing.
