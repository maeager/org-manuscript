\summary{%
This thesis presents a novel biophysically-realistic neural network
(BNN) model of the stellate cell microcircuit in the cochlear nucleus. This
circuit provides a robust spectral representation of sound and plays an
essential part in speech communication.  The model was optimised using rigorous
sequential methods and simultaneous genetic algorithms. The analyses of the
results demonstrate the utility of this approach for improving BNN models and
using BNN models to help understand complex neural processing.
