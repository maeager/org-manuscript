#  TITLE: The stellate microcircuit of the cochlear nucleus: design and optimisation of a biophysically-realistic neural network



Biophysically-realistic neural network (BNN) models require
quality design and optimisation methods in order to best
advance understanding of complex neural processing.  This
thesis presents a novel BNN model of the cochlear nucleus stellate
microcircuit, which provides a robust spectral
representation of sound and plays an essential part in speech
communication.  The model was optimised using rigorous
sequential methods and simultaneous genetic algorithms.
The results of the analysis demonstrate the
utility of this approach for improving BNN models.

# In order to create a realistic microcircuit, the parameter optimisation
# routine needs to be developed in sequential stages.  

# The connections
# within the \CNSM model (Figure \ref{fig:microcircuit}) were developed
# using such a sequential method of optimisation steps.  

# Parameters in the
# microcircuit can be separated into two classes: cell-based and
# connectivity-based.

# The development of methods for constraining new models is an important step for
# generating microcircuits and larger networks.  The study reported in this
# chapter has shown that the \GA is an adequate method for parameter optimisation
# and that the \ST and \AIV cost functions are comparably good methods for
# constraining \BNNs. Further development is needed to enhance the robustness of
# the cost function methods to input noise, especially for sensitivity and
# robustness of inhibitory connections in the \CN stellate network.

stellate microcircuit, which provides a robust spectral representation of sound
