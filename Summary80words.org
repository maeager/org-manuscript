#  TITLE: The stellate microcircuit of the cochlear nucleus: design and optimisation of a biophysically-realistic neural network



Biophysically-realistic neural network (BNN) models require
quality design and optimisation methods in order to best
advance understanding of complex neural processing.  This
thesis presents a novel BNN model of the cochlear nucleus stellate
microcircuit, which provides a robust spectral
representation of sound and plays an essential part in speech
communication.  The model was optimised using rigorous
sequential methods and simultaneous genetic algorithms.
The results of the analysis demonstrate the
utility of this approach for improving BNN models.

# The purpose of the optimisation experiments was to
# develop a biophysically-realistic neural network model of the stellate
# microcircuit in the cochlear nucleus.  

# The methods used in this section
# are a practical and realistic means for constructing microcircuits with
# sensory or feature-based topography. 

# They exploit extensive experimental
# evidence that describes the behaviour of each interneuron in the
# network.  


# draws on the wealth of experimental data accumulated in auditory
# neuroscience to create a detailed \BNN model of the T stellate
# microcircuit in the cochlear nucleus (hereafter referred to as the \CNSM
# model, as described in Chapter \ref{sec:MethodsChapter}).  

# The design
# and methods used for the construction of the model provide insights
# relevant to other neural network models of the brain, especially those
# that use sensory pathways.

# Despite advances in computational neuroscience, it remains a challenging
# task to develop an accurate representation of the complex behaviour of
# real neural networks.  

# Choices, guesses and assumptions continue to be
# integral parts of neuronal modelling \citep{SegevBurkeEtAl:1998}.  

# With
# the acceleration of computational power and enhanced experimental
# techniques in multi-unit recordings, it is possible to develop more
# detailed neural models.

# In order to create a realistic microcircuit, the parameter optimisation
# routine needs to be developed in sequential stages.  

# The connections
# within the \CNSM model (Figure \ref{fig:microcircuit}) were developed
# using such a sequential method of optimisation steps.  

# Parameters in the
# microcircuit can be separated into two classes: cell-based and
# connectivity-based.

# The development of methods for constraining new models is an important step for
# generating microcircuits and larger networks.  The study reported in this
# chapter has shown that the \GA is an adequate method for parameter optimisation
# and that the \ST and \AIV cost functions are comparably good methods for
# constraining \BNNs. Further development is needed to enhance the robustness of
# the cost function methods to input noise, especially for sensitivity and
# robustness of inhibitory connections in the \CN stellate network.
